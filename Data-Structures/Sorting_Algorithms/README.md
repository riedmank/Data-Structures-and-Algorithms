# Sorting Algorithms
## Insertion Sort
### Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n^2) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n^2) because we have to iterate over the length of the array for every element of the array
- Space is O(1) because we are making all of the swaps in place

## Quick Sort
### Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n^2) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n^2) because we have to iterate over the array multiple times
- Space is O(1) because we are making all of the swaps in place
