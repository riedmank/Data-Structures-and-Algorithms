# Animal Shelter
## Description
Make an Animal Shelter Class that Enqueues and Dequeueus Animals.  Dequeue based on a string.

## Approach and Efficiency
### Enqueue
Big O Time: O(1) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(1) because only one Animal is being added to the Animal Shelter
- Space is O(1) because we aren't making any new Animals
### Dequeue
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n) because we have to reset the order of the line so that Front is at the Front
- Space is O(1) because we aren't allocating any new memory
