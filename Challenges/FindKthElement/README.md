# Kth from the end of a Linked List

## Challenge
Given a value K, find the Kth value from the end of the Linked List and return the value of the Node.

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is technically O(2n) which is just O(n) since constants are ignored when taking Big O into consideration.  Big O is O(n) because we have to traverse the Linked List to find the target Node.
- Space is O(1) because there is no additional memory allocated.
