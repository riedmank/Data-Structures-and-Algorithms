# Breadth First Traversal
## Challenge
Implement a method that performs a Breadth First Traversal of a binary Tree.

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(w)
- Time is O(n) because we have to traverse over all of the nodes in the tree
- Space is O(w) because the most amount of space we will ever need depends upon the width of the Binary Tree
