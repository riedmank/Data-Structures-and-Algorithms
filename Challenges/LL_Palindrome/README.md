# Linked List Palindrome
## Challenge
Given a Linked List, determine if it is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards)

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(n)
- Time is O(n) because we have to traverse the Linked List
- Space is O(n) because we create and fill an array of Node values
