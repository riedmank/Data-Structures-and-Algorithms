# Queues with Stacks
## Description
Using two Stacks, replicate the First In First Out functionality of a Queue

## Approach and Efficiency
### Enqueue
Big O Time: O(1) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(1) because only one Node is being added to the Queue
- Space is O(1) because there is no additional memory being allocated
### Dequeue
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n) because we need to Pop the Nodes off of the Queue to reach the first Node in the Queue
- Space is O(1) because there is no additional memory being allocated
