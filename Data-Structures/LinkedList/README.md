# Linked List Data Structure
## Description

## Method Description
- Print 
-- O(n) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method traverses the Linked List and prints the contents

- Add
-- O(1) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method adds a node to the head of the Linked List

- Append
-- O(n) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method appends a node to the end of the Linked List

- Add Before
-- O(n) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method adds a node before the specified node in the Linked List

- Add After
-- O(n) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method adds a node after the specified node in the Linked List

- Find
-- O(n) Time, O(1) Space
-- This method finds a value in the Linked List and returns the node where it was found or null or if the value was not found
