# Insert and shift middle index of array

## Challenge
Given an array and a value, create a new array with the value inserted into the middle of the array.

## Approach & Efficiency 
Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(n)
- For this particular code challenge, Big O of Time and Big O of Space are both O(n). Big O of Time is O(n) becuase we need to iterate through an array of n number of elements.  Big O of Space is O(n) becuase we need to instatiate a new array of n number of elements in order to insert a new value.
