# Eenie Meenie Meine Moe
## Challenge 
Given a number, play Eenie Meenie Meine Moe(EMMM) and return the last Node that is in.

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n) because we have to iterate over the Queue until every Node is out
- Space is O(1) because we don't allocate any additional memory
