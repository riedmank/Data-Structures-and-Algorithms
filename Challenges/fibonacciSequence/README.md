# Fibonacci Sequence

## Challenge
Given a number n return the nth sequence in the Fibonacci Sequence

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Spacec = O(1)
- Big O Time: O(1) since we are only making a mathematical calculation and not looping through an array
- Big O Space: O(1) because are we only instantiating 4 value type variables.
