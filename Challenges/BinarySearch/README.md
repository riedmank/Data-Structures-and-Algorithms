# Binary Search

## Challenge
Given a sorted array and a target value, write a method that finds the target value and returns the index of the location in the array.
If the value is not in the array, return -1.

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time = O(logn) // Big O Space = O(1)
- For this code challenge, Big O of Time is O(logn) because everytime the algorithm makes a search, half of the array is discarded.
- Big O of Space is O(1) because we are not instantiating any new arrays or objects.
