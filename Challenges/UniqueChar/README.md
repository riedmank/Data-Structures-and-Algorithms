# Unique Character
## Description
Given a string, determine if it is made up of all unique characters (spaces don't count, method is case sensitive)

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(n)
- Time is O(n) because we have to iterate over the string to put it into the hash table.
- Space is O(n) because we have to declare a hash table.
