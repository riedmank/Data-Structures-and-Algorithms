# Direct Flight Trip Finder
## Description
Given a trip itinerary, determine if all flights are direct and return their combined cost.

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n^2) // Big O Space: O(1)
- Time is O(n^2) because my method performs a loop within a loop.
- Space is O(1) because I don't allocate any additional memory.
