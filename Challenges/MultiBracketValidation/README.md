# Mulit Bracket Validation
## Description
Given a string, return true if all open brackets "[", curlies "{", and parans "(" have a closing bracket "]", curly "}", or paran ")".

## Approach and Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n) // Big O Space: O(n)
- Time is O(n) because we have to iterate over the entire word
- Space is O(n) because we have to allocate memory for a new Stack
